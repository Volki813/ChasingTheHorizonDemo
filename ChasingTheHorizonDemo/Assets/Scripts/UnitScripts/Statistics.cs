    //very cool thing we can do where we can define how operaters affect instances of the struct
    // ie: we can define adding two of the struct together and it will add all of the stats

    //note these are used for the WHOLE object so if we just need to compare say strength we can just use statistics.strength +-*/etc.

    //I imagine stuff like this will become useful when we implemenet skills
    //We can also add more operators or redefine how they work in the future. Maybe a BST operator could be useful etc.
